#Summer of Node.js First Day

###by: Sean Zawicki

Today marks the first day of a journey I will be taking with @Voxer.  The company has graciously hosted four interns (listed alphabetically):

*    [DJ Gardiner](http://twitter.com/sentientwaffle)
*    [David Trejo](http://twitter.com/ddtrejo)
*    [Sean Zawicki](http://twitter.com/seanzawi) (myself)


While there are many exciting facets of the coming months; I feel as though the educational aspect of this internship is by far the most intriguing.  Not only will we be learning about some awesome technologies involved with Node and Voxer's in-house tech stack; but we will be learning from some of the greatest minds in our industry.  Even before the internship started I have taken to heart some excellent advice from people in the bay.

Talking with [dshaw](http://twitter.com/dshaw) about my apprehension to publish code for fear of simplicity, he told me (I'm paraphrasing) "Often times the smartest people are the ones willing to throw their code out there, even if it's wrong.  Because in taking that risk, they're learning something and they're trying."

Another great gem from guest James Halliday (aka [@substack](http://twitter.com/substack)) falls along those same lines (again I'm paraphrasing).  "Usually the best thing to do is just post a module.  You can always go back and re-iterate on it later".

Being a very self-conscious person, I often feel as though my code is weak and not very well structured.  I'm often very apprehensive to show my work to someone else and often avoid this whenever possible.  Yet working with this group, I'm hoping to expand my horizons and try to be more outgoing.  Because when all is said and done, what's the worst that can happen?
